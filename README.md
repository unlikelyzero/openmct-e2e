# Open MCT telemetry client e2e tests

These automated test verify acceptance criteria for the [telemetry-client](https://github.com/shefalijoshi/telemetry-client) and [openmct-tutorial](https://github.com/nasa/openmct-tutorial.git) applications.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the tests, you must first set up the target environment by following the steps
outlined [here](https://github.com/shefalijoshi/telemetry-client#telemetry-client)

Once you have verified that the client is launched, you can install this test repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/unlikelyzero/openmct-e2e.git
npm install
```

At this point, you can decide whether you want to run all the tests at once headlessly, or run the
tests with the Cypress GUI Playground.

## Headless

```
npm run headless
```

## Cypress GUI Playground

```
npm run cypress
```
